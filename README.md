### Tech
* [Google web toolkit] - GWT is a development toolkit for building and optimizing complex browser-based applications. Its goal is to enable productive development of high-performance web applications without the developer having to be an expert in browser quirks, XMLHttpRequest, and JavaScript.
* [Sencha’s Gtx] Sencha GXT is the most comprehensive Java framework for building feature-rich web applications. It uses the GWT (formerly Google Web Toolkit) compiler, allowing developers to write applications in Java and compile their code into highly optimized cross-platform HTML5 code.
